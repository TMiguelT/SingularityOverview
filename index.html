# Singularity

.center[![](singularity.png)]

---

## Motivation

You probably want to use Singularity for the same reasons you would want to use Docker, or any other container technology:
* You want reproducibility in your analyses - fixed and checksummed versions of tools
* You don't want to have to manually install (or ask the sysadmins to) all the tools you need
* You want your pipeline to be portable, and runnable on cloud or another HPC
* You want to use an out-of-the-box pipeline, written in WDL, CWL, SnakeMake, Nextflow etc

---

## Motivation
### Why not use Docker?
* The [Docker daemon attack surface](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface) refers to the fact that:
    * You can mount any filesystem into a Docker image, and them modify it inside that container
    * Even if this filesystem is owned by someone else, you can still do this, because Docker runs as root
    * Inside this container you can also gain root permissions
* This means that Docker is not suitable for use in shared HPC systems

---

## Replacing Docker CLI commands

Purpose | Docker | Singularity
--- | --- | ---
Obtaining an image from Docker Hub | `docker pull ubuntu` | `singularity pull docker://ubuntu`
Running an image | `docker run biocontainers/bwa` | `singularity run docker://biocontainers/bwa`
Running an image with a custom command | `docker run --entrypoint ls ubuntu -a` | `singularity exec docker://ubuntu ls -a`
Building from a Dockerfile | `docker build -t my_image .` | Not available
Bind mounting | `docker run -v /path/to/inputs:/inputs index /inputs/input.bam` | `singularity exec --bind /path/to/inputs:/inputs samtools index /inputs/input.bam`

---

## Full CLI

```

  singularity [global options...] \<command\>

  build       Build a new Singularity container
  capability  Manage Linux capabilities on containers
  exec        Execute a command within container
  inspect     Display metadata for container if available
  instance    Manage containers running in the background
  keys        Manage OpenPGP key stores
  pull        Pull a container from a URI
  push        Push a container to a Library URI
  run         Launch a runscript within container
  run-help    Display help for container if available
  search      Search the library
  shell       Run a Bourne shell within container
  sign        Attach cryptographic signatures to container
  test        Run defined tests for this particular container
  verify      Verify cryptographic signatures on container
  version     Show application version
```

## Singularity Pitfalls
### Writeable Images

* Docker users a layered filesystem, which means that the container sees the contents of the base image, but whenever it writes new data, it does so on a new, writeable layer of the filesystem.
* By default, Singularity has no writeable layer, which means that any files that write to anywhere on the image (except for mounted directories) will fail:
```bash
singularity exec docker://ubuntu bash -c 'touch /root/test.txt'
touch: cannot touch '/root/test.txt': Permission denied
```
* However, there are workarounds:
    * If you have root, you can run an image with `--overlay`, which will use a Docker-esque overlay
    * You can add a bind mount where the container needs to write
    * Singularity automatically bind mounts `$HOME`, `/tmp`, and other useful directories, so most well designed tools will not fail

---

## Image Formats

* Singularity image formats have changed considerably since Singularity 2
* There are now only two options:
    * `.sif`, Singularity's custom image format. It is compressed and read-only
    * A sandbox directory, which is writeable and uncompressed.
* You should use the `.sif` format whenever possible

---

## Native Singularity Images

Singularity's equivalent of a Dockerfile is a definition file (`.def`):

```
Bootstrap: docker
From: ubuntu:16.04

%post
    apt-get -y update
    apt-get -y install fortune cowsay lolcat

%environment
    export LC_ALL=C
    export PATH=/usr/games:$PATH

%runscript
    fortune | cowsay | lolcat
```
---

## Native Singularity Images

The definition file has the following sections:

* The header: defines the base OS or image used to build this image
* `%setup`: Commands executed on the host system outside of the container after the base OS has been installed
* `%files`: allows you to copy files from your host system into the container
* `%environment`: allows you to define environment variables that will be set at runtime.
* `%post`: Commands executed within the container after the base OS has been installed at build time
* `%runscript`: The script or command that is run when this image is `singularity run`

---

## Native Singularity Images

* You can build and run an image using the definition file like this:
    ```bash
    sudo singularity build lolcow.sif lolcow.def
    singularity run lolcow.sif
    ```
* Note that this requires root!

---

## Singularity with Workflow Engines
### Cromwell (CWL and WDL)
Cromwell does not have native support for Singularity, but it does let you customize the command run when it needs to submit a containerized job:

```
submit-docker = """
    # Ensure singularity is loaded if it's installed as a module
    module load Singularity/3.0.1

    # Build the Docker image into a singularity image
    IMAGE=${cwd}/${docker}.sif
    singularity build $IMAGE docker://${docker}

    # Submit the script to SLURM
    sbatch \
      --wait \
      -J ${job_name} \
      -D ${cwd} \
      -o ${cwd}/execution/stdout \
      -e ${cwd}/execution/stderr \
      -t ${runtime_minutes} \
      ${"-c " + cpus} \
      --mem-per-cpu=${requested_memory_mb_per_core} \
      --wrap "singularity exec --bind ${cwd}:${docker_cwd} $IMAGE ${job_shell} ${script}"
"""
```

---

### Snakemake
Snakemake has native Singularity support.

You can define a rule like this:

```
rule NAME:
    input:
        "table.txt"
    output:
        "plots/myplot.pdf"
    singularity:
        "docker://joseespinosa/docker-r-ggplot2"
    script:
        "scripts/plot-stuff.R"

```

And then run it like this:

```bash
snakemake --use-singularity
```
